TODO:

Here is a list of things we feel are important for strong emacs support.
I believe it is worth while to place this information here for two reasons:
1. So users can see what ideas are in mind for the future.
2. So anyone can assist to implement these ideas!

Things already done:

- offer an installation script 
- Offer an uninstall script.
- Emacs functions to toggle speaking and brailling of dollar signs.
- Support for the preprocessor
- Could the emacs code use lisp advice around the emacs functions so
that its the functions that we modify rather than the keystroke?  At
the moment if someone has non-standard keybindings in emacs for
previous and next line then the code will mess them up.  On a similar
note, could we advise the character insertion functions so that the
braille is updated automatically when typing?
(done for Braille and speech) 
- Perhaps a latex-access-equation function could be useful to convert a region of text into Braille and expanding the echo area.
We would just feed the python code one line at a time in a loop. Would be useful
when rereading an examination I think.
(done including alignment support)
- Functionality to show x number of prior lines as well as the current one when typing. The echo
area is expanded, and this is very useful for solving equations. 
The number of lines shown in the echo area i.e. how many lines above the current line
we show is a setting available to the user. 
- Matrix support 
- Allow speech and Braille to be disabled independently of each other
This shouldn't be to hard if we divide latex-access-on/off into
speech/braille specific functions, and update the toggle code.

Things still needing to be implemented:

- Correct handling of my speech markup for bold, etc.
(I think with some string manipulation in lisp this shouldn't be too hard
with the available voice-locking functions of emacspeak.)
- Consistant key bindings for many functions (toggling dollars, latex-access speech/braille independently, preprocessor)
- We need to find a better way of displaying the Braille translation, because 
we are blocking important messages to the echo area.
