TODO:

Here is a list of things we feel are important for strong emacs support.
I believe it is worth while to place this information here for two reasons:
1. So users can see what ideas are in mind for the future.
2. So anyone can assist to implement these ideas!

Things still needing to be implemented:

- Correct handling of my speech markup for bold, etc.
(I think with some string manipulation in lisp this shouldn't be too hard
with the available voice-locking functions of emacspeak.) (Has this been
completed yet, or is there still work to be done)? 
- Emacspeak has some nice speech functionality, which can be used for
standard latex very well, but currently latex-access overides such
functionality. Therefore, perhaps latex-access should only be used when
speaking mathematics i.e. text which emacs considers to be in latex math
mode by either surrounding dollar signs, or the environment. The text
properties I believe indicate this, but there may be an easier way. 

Things already done:

- Emacs functions to toggle speaking and brailling of dollar signs.
- Support for the preprocessor
- Could the emacs code use lisp advice around the emacs functions so
that its the functions that we modify rather than the keystroke?  At
the moment if someone has non-standard keybindings in emacs for
previous and next line then the code will mess them up.  On a similar
note, could we advise the character insertion functions so that the
braille is updated automatically when typing?
(done for Braille and speech) 
- Perhaps a latex-access-equation function could be useful to convert a region of text into Braille and expanding the echo area.
We would just feed the python code one line at a time in a loop. Would be useful
when rereading an examination I think.
(done including alignment support)
- Matrix support via emacs table mode. 
- Allow speech and Braille to be disabled independently of each other
This shouldn't be to hard if we divide latex-access-on/off into
speech/braille specific functions, and update the toggle code.
- We need to find a better way of displaying the Braille translation, because 
we are blocking important messages to the echo area. (Done, but see bugs
file)
