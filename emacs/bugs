BUGS:

This file is to list any bugs you find with the emacs side of the
package. This will be helpful so we know where to look for a complete
list of all bugs which require attention.

It may be something I need to investigate when time permits -- not a huge issue though.
Fixed of r127 -- load python module only once.
