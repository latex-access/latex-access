BUGS:

This file is to list any bugs you find with the emacs side of the
package. This will be helpful so we know where to look for a complete
list of all bugs which require attention.

Bugs which have been fixed:

- For some reason emacspeak says "." (dot) before the translation in speech.
I disable the Braille and this still occurs, do other users see this?
It may be something I need to investigate when time permits -- not a huge issue though.
Fixed of r127 -- load python module only once.

- Part of the Braille translation was spoken by emacspeak. (should be
fixed now
- Latex-access toggle didn't work properly when disabled, nothing was
Brailled/voiced, and when enabling, no Braille output for the latex
access enabled message was observed. 
Fixed of R147.
