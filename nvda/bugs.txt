The following is a list of buggs found in the latex_access GlobalPlugin
for NVDA.  Feel free to add more as they arise, and remove ones that are
fixed.

	* Repetitive speech: Because NVDA's default
behaviour is not being overidden, the current line is being spoken as
normal, and then the plugin is causing that same line to be spoken again,
whether translation is on or off.  Also the
line is being spoken whenever the user moves by character and word,
not just by line.  Also the GetLine method
in the GlobalPlugin class does not honour any config settings
in NVDA such as speakTypedCharacters and SpeakTypedWords.
I need to find a way around this soon.
