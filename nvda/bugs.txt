The following is a list of buggs found in the latex_access GlobalPlugin
for NVDA.  Feel free to add more as they arise, and remove ones that are
fixed.

	* TypeErrors: NVDA doesn't like the overide of the caret event.
I am not sure how to fix this yet.  The log is pasted below:
ERROR - eventHandler.executeEvent (17:41:30):
