The following is a list of buggs found in the latex_access GlobalPlugin
for NVDA.  Feel free to add more as they arise, and remove ones that are
fixed.

	* Lagging: NVDA lags a bit when using a braille display while using the plugin.  I think this may be because of the way we go back to default behaviour: the plugin brailles the non-translated current line as a message instead of using the usual cursor functionality.  I am not sure how to implement with yet however.
