This is a todo file for the latex_access GlobalPlugin for NVDA, where
new features are put to be worked on or fixed.

	* Important! Use events instead of scripts: This is a priority,
          however hard to implement as certain events can be unreliable
          in different situations, and there is no real list of all
          events so they are hard to find.  The best event to use would
          probably be the IAcessible event, event_caret, but I haven't
          written the code for that yet.

	* Add translations of braille without the message timing out
          after a configgored amount of time - this currently cannot be
          done.  Suggestion: File an enhancement in the issue tracker
          for a message function that will not time out, or an extra
          argument in the existing function for overiding the option in
          the ini file if this can be done.  Issue: to get this done by
          the developers, we need good justification for the suggestion.

	* Add support for the preprocessor - To be done.
		- Make a GUI
	perhaps with wxPython for the preprocessor: To be done.

	* Add support for the matrix - To be done.
	* Translate lines of
LaTeX into nemeth braille and speech: Under development.
