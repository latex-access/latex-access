This is a todo file for the latex_access GlobalPlugin for NVDA, where
new features are put to be worked on or fixed.

	* Add translation of braille without the message timing out
          after a configgored amount of time - this currently cannot be
          done.  Suggestion: File an enhancement in the issue tracker
          for a message function that will not time out, or an extra
          argument in the existing function for overiding the option in
          the ini file if this can be done.  Issue: to get this done by
          the developers, we need good justification for the suggestion.

	* Add support for the preprocessor - to be done.
		- Make a GUI
		perhaps with wxPython for the preprocessor: To be done.

	* Add support for the matrix - being done.
	* Translate lines of
LaTeX into Nemeth braille and speech: completed.
