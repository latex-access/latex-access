This is a toto file for the latex_access GlobalPlugin for NVDA, where new features are put to be worked on or fixed.

	* Important! Use events instead of scripts: This is a priority, however hard to implement as certain events can be unreliable in different situations, and there 	is no real list of all events so they are hard to find.
	* Add translations of braille without the message timing out after a configgored amount of time - this currently cannot be done.  Suggestion: File an 	enhancement in the ussue tracker for a message function that will not time out, or an extra argument in the existing function for overiding the option in the 	ini file if this can be done.  Issue: to get this done by the developers, we need good justification for the suggestion.
	* Add support for the preprocessor - To be done.
		- Make a GUI perhaps with wxPython for the preprocessor: To be done.
	* Add support for the matrix - To be done.
	* Translate lines of LaTeX into nemeth braille and speech: Under development.
